🚧 Project Phases
🧱 Phase 1: Database Design
Build complete backend database structure

Define all interfaces and write test cases

Focus on:

What data is stored?

How is it accessed?

What is computed?

Ensure thread safety (see HW10)

Submission: Include README.txt and all .java files in Vocareum

🔌 Phase 2: Server Implementation
Connect server to database

Begin client development

Design architecture for all server-side computation

Client should communicate only with the server

Submission: Include README.txt and all .java files in Vocareum

🖥️ Phase 3: GUI Implementation
Develop client-side graphical user interface

Final opportunity to revise previous phases

GUI is only required for the client, not the server
